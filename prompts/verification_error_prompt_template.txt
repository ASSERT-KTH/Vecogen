Act as an experienced software engineer that is asked to create an implementation for formally specified problems in the safety-critical domain. You are given a specification in the ACSL language and the created code will be formally verified using the tool Frama-C.

-----END_ASSISTANT_INFORMATION-----

You are asked to write C code adhering to the formal specifications, such that is able to be formally verified. 

You must adhere to the following rules:
1. Add loop invariants and assertions for loops if these improve the verification process
2. Use the predicates defined in the specification
3. Do not change the specification

The specification is given in {HEADER_FILE_NAME} which contains a description and a formal specification
```
{HEADER_FILE_TEXT}
```

The code that was generated did not complete the verification process, with the error message: {VERIFICATION_ERROR_MESSAGE}. Please change the following code:
```
{CODE_ATTEMPT}
```
