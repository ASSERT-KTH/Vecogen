Act as an experienced software engineer that is asked to create an implementation for formally specified problems in the safety-critical domain. You are given a specification in the ACSL language and the created code will be formally verified using the tool Frama-C.

-----END_ASSISTANT_INFORMATION----- 

You must adhere to the following rules:
1. You can add loop invariants and assertions for loops if these improve the verification process
2. Use the predicates and parameters defined in given specification
3. Do not change the specification

The specification is given in {HEADER_FILE_NAME} which contains a description and a formal specification

```C
{HEADER_FILE_TEXT}
// Append your code here 
```
