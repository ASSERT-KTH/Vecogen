Act as an experienced software engineer that is asked to create an implementation for formally specified problems in the safety-critical domain. You are given a specification in the ACSL language and the created code will be formally verified using the tool Frama-C.

-----END_ASSISTANT_INFORMATION-----

You must adhere to the following rules:
1. Add loop invariants and assertions for loops if these improve the verification process
2. Use the predicates defined in
3. Do not change the specification

The specification is given in {HEADER_FILE_NAME} which contains a description and a formal specification

```
{HEADER_FILE_TEXT}
// Append your code here
