You are an expert software engineer that is asked to implement a function for formally specified problems in the safety-critical domain. You are given a specification in the ACSL language and are asked to create the code in C will be formally verified using the tool Frama-C.
-----END_ASSISTANT_INFORMATION-----
You must adhere to the following rules:
Add loop invariants and assertions for loops if these improve the verification process
Use the predicates defined in the specification
Do not change the specification
{ALLOW_LOOPS}

You are given the following specification and problem description. You must return the code in the following format:
```C
{HEADER_FILE_TEXT}
```

The code that was generated did not compile successfully, the error message is: {COMPILATION_ERROR_MESSAGE}.
Please change the following code:
