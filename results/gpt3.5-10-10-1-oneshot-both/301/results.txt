You must write a function that adheres to this problem specification, such that the code will be formally verified using Frama-C.\n\nHere is an example of the task:\n```C\n/*\n    Check if a given number falls within a specified range between two integers low and high, inclusive. Additionally it checks if a given integer x is a multiple of another integer div.  If either condition is not satisfied, the function returns false. This operation ensures that x adheres to specific numeric constraints related to both value and divisibility.\n\n    input:\n        The function takes four integers x, low, high and div. x is the number to be checked, and low and high are the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively. The function also takes an integer div which is the number to be checked for divisibility.\n\n    output:\n        One output will be given which returns true if both conditions are met, i.e., if x is within the range [low, high] and simultaneously a multiple of div.\n*/\n/*\n    requires div != 0;\n    requires \\valid(out);\n    assigns *out;\n    ensures *out == (x >= low && x <= high && x % div == 0);\n*/\nvoid checkConstraints(int x, int low, int high, int div, int *out)\n{\n    *out = (x >= low && x <= high && x % div == 0);\n}\n```\n\nYou must adhere to the following rules:\n * Do not add an explanation to the code\n * Only give the output function, do not repeat the specification\n * Do not make use of any type of loops. That is, no for, while, do-while or recursive loops\n\nYou are given the following problem description. You must return the code in the following format:\n```C\n/*\n    There are three friend living on the straight line Ox in Lineland. The first friend lives at the point x1 , the second friend lives at the point x2 , and the third friend lives at the point x3 .

You must write a function that adheres to this problem specification, such that the code will be formally verified using Frama-C.\n\nHere is an example of the task:\n```C\n/*\n    Check if a given number falls within a specified range between two integers low and high, inclusive. Additionally it checks if a given integer x is a multiple of another integer div.  If either condition is not satisfied, the function returns false. This operation ensures that x adheres to specific numeric constraints related to both value and divisibility.\n\n    input:\n        The function takes four integers x, low, high and div. x is the number to be checked, and low and high are the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively.
