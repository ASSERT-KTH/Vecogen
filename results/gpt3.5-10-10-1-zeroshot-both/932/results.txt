He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k .

That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k .

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k .

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k .
