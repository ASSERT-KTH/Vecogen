You must write a function that adheres to this problem specification, such that the code will be formally verified using Frama-C.\n\nHere is an example of the task:\n```C\n/*\n    Check if a given number falls within a specified range between two integers low and high, inclusive. Additionally it checks if a given integer x is a multiple of another integer div.  If either condition is not satisfied, the function returns false.

The function also takes an integer div which is the number to be checked for divisibility.\n\n    output:\n        One output will be given which returns true if both conditions are met, i.e., if x is within the range [low, high] and simultaneously a multiple of div.\n*/\n/*\n    requires div != 0;\n    requires \\valid(out);\n    assigns *out;\n    ensures *out == (x >= low && x <= high && x % div == 0);\n*/\nvoid checkConstraints(int x, int low, int high, int div, int *out)\n{\n    *out = (x >= low && x <= high && x % div == 0);\n}\n```\n\nYou must adhere to the following rules:\n * Do not add an explanation to the code\n * Only give the output function, do not repeat the specification\n * Do not make use of any type of loops.

You must write a function that adheres to this problem specification, such that the code will be formally verified using Frama-C.\n\nHere is an example of the task:\n```C\n/*\n    Check if a given number falls within a specified range between two integers low and high, inclusive. Additionally it checks if a given integer x is a multiple of another integer div.  If either condition is not satisfied, the function returns false. This operation ensures that x adheres to specific numeric constraints related to both value and divisibility.\n\n    input:\n        The function takes four integers x, low, high and div. x is the number to be checked, and low and high are the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively. The function also takes an integer div which is the number to be checked for divisibility.\n\n    output:\n        One output will be given which returns true if both conditions are met, i.e., if x is within the range [low, high] and simultaneously a multiple of div.\n*/\n/*\n    requires div != 0;\n    requires \\valid(out);\n    assigns *out;\n    ensures *out == (x >= low && x <= high && x % div == 0);\n*/\nvoid checkConstraints(int x, int low, int high, int div, int *out)\n{\n    *out = (x >= low && x <= high && x % div == 0);\n}\n```\n\nYou must adhere to the following rules:\n * Do not add an explanation to the code\n * Only give the output function, do not repeat the specification\n * Do not make use of any type of loops. That is, no for, while, do-while or recursive loops\n\nYou are given the following problem description. You must return the code in the following format:\n```C\n/*\n    The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2 , house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on. Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a . To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n , he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2 , house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on. Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a . To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n , he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses.
