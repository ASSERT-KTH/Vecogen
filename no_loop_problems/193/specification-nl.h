/*
    On the planet Mars a year lasts exactly n days (there are no leap years on Mars). But Martians have the same weeks as earthlings — 5 work days and then 2 days off. Your task is to determine the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.

    Input
    The input contains a positive integer n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 ) — the number of days in a year on Mars.

    Output
    Output two integers — the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.
