/*
    Petr wants to make a calendar for current month. For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture: Petr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month? Assume that the year is non-leap.
