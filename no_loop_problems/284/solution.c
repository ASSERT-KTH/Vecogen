    Today an outstanding event is going to happen in the forest â€” hedgehog Filya will come to his old fried Sonya! Sonya is an owl and she sleeps during the day and stay awake from minute l 1 to minute r 1 inclusive. Also, during the minute k she prinks and is unavailable for Filya. Filya works a lot and he plans to visit Sonya from minute l 2 to minute r 2 inclusive. Calculate the number of minutes they will be able to spend together.
