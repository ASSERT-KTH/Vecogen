    One day the Codeforces round author sat exams. He had n exams and he needed to get an integer from 2 to 5 for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams. Help the author and find the minimum number of exams he will have to re-sit if he passes the exams in the way that makes the sum of marks for all n exams equal exactly k .
