/*  Dasha and Stairs
    On her way to programming school tiger Dasha faced her first test — a huge staircase! The steps were numbered from one to infinity. As we know, tigers are very fond of all striped things, it is possible that it has something to do with their color. So on some interval of her way she calculated two values — the number of steps with even and odd numbers. You need to check whether there is an interval of steps from the l -th to the r -th (1 ≤ l ≤ r ) , for which values that Dasha has found are correct.*/
