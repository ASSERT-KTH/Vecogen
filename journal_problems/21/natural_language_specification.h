/*In a context where character manipulation is necessary, the goal is to transform 
  a given character by shifting its ASCII value. The task involves taking a character 
  input and adjusting its value in a specific manner.

  Input
  A single character variable 'c' which is expected to be in the range of 
  0 to 127, representing valid ASCII values.

  Output
  The output is a character value that remains within the ASCII range of 
  0 to 127. It should be the result of subtracting 32 from the input character's 
  ASCII value.
