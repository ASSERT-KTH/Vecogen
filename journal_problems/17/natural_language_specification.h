/*The goal is to perform multiplication of two integers while ensuring that the result remains within the valid range of integer values.

  Input:
      - Two integers, a and b.
      - Each integer can take any value within the range of a standard 32-bit signed integer

  Output:
      - The product of the two integers, which is also an integer.
      - The output will be valid as long as the product does not exceed the limits of a 32-bit signed integer.
