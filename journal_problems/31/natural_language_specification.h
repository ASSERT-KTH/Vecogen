/*
    In a scenario where you need to analyze the calendar months, the goal is to determine the number of months that contain 30 days. The task involves evaluating the months in order starting from January; the numerical representation ranges from 1 to 12 and repeats cyclically when the count exceeds 12.

    Input
    The input consists of a single integer variable representing the number of months to consider, which must be within the range of 0 to INT_MAX, inclusive.

    Output
    The output is a single integer value that indicates the count of months, from January up to the specified number of months, that have exactly 30 days. The result will be a non-negative integer.
