/*In a scenario involving geometric shapes, the goal is to compute the surface area of a square pyramid. 
  This pyramid is defined by its base edge length and height, both of which must be positive values.

  Input
  - Two integers, baseEdge and height. 
  - The value of baseEdge must be greater than 0.
  - The value of height must also be greater than 0.

  Output
  - A single integer representing the surface area of the square pyramid, calculated based on the provided dimensions.
