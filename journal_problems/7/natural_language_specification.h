/*This function's purpose is to calculate either the maximum or minimum of two integers based on the given enumeration value. The function uses a typedef enum 'kind' with two possible values: Max and Min. It takes in three parameters: an enum 'k' of type 'kind', and two integers 'x' and 'y'.

  The goal of the 'extremum' function is to determine the maximum or minimum value between two integers 'x' and 'y'. The function decides which operation to perform based on the value of the enum 'k'. If 'k' equals 'Max', the function will return the maximum of 'x' and 'y'. Conversely, if 'k' equals 'Min', the function will return the minimum of 'x' and 'y'. The function does not modify any external or global variables.

  Input
  The function 'extremum' takes three inputs: a value of enum 'kind' (either 'Max' or 'Min'), and two integers 'x' and 'y'. The enum 'kind' determines the behavior of the function, and 'x' and 'y' are the integers between which the function will determine the maximum or minimum.

  Output
  The 'extremum' function returns an integer that is either the maximum or minimum of the two input integers 'x' and 'y', based on the value of the enum 'k'.
