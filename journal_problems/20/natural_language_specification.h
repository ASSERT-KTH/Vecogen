/*In a business context, it is often important to determine the financial outcome of a transaction involving buying and selling goods. The goal is to assess whether a loss has occurred based on the costs and selling prices.

    Input
    The function takes two integer values representing monetary amounts: costPrice and sellingPrice. Both of these values must be non-negative integers, with costPrice representing the expense incurred to acquire a product, and sellingPrice representing the revenue from selling that product.

    Output
    The function returns an integer value that indicates the financial loss of the transaction, if any. If the costPrice is greater than the sellingPrice, the output will be the amount of the loss incurred.
