/*An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x (x > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.

    Input
    The first input contains an integer x (1 <= x <= 1000000) â€” The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Output
    The minimum number of steps that elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x.
