He had n exams and he needed to get an integer from 2 to 5 for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams. Help the author and find the minimum number of exams he will have to re-sit if he passes the exams in the way that makes the sum of marks for all n exams equal exactly k .\n\n    Input\n    The input contains space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 250) \u2014 the number of exams and the required sum of marks. It is guaranteed that there exists a way to pass n exams in the way that makes the sum of marks equal exactly k .\n\n    Output\n    Output the single number \u2014 the minimum number of exams that the author will get a 2 for, considering that the sum of marks for all exams must equal k.\n*/\n```\nACSL FORMAL SPECIFICATION:\n```c\n/*@\npredicate IsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    result == n2;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    n2 < result;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n;\n*/\n\n/*@\nrequires  1 <= n <= 50;\n    requires  1 <= k <= 250;\n    requires ExistsPossibleConfiguration(n, k);\n    assigns \\nothing;\n    ensures IsPossibleConfiguration(n, k, \\result);\n    ensures !ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(n, k, \\result);\n*/\n```\nFUNCTION SIGNATURE:\n```c\nint calculateMinimumExamsToResitForGivenSum(int n, int k);\n```\n--- END CONTEXT ---\n\nYOUR TASK:\n\nYou must adhere to the following rules:\n * Keep the function signature exactly as provided.\n * Respect all ACSL pre- and postconditions.\n * If the natural language description and ACSL conflict, follow the ACSL.\n * Do not repeat the natural language description, the ACSL, or the extra code.\n * Do not add explanations or comments.\n * Do not use any type of loops (for, while, do-while).

He had n exams and he needed to get an integer from 2 to 5 for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all.

He had n exams and he needed to get an integer from 2 to 5 for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams. Help the author and find the minimum number of exams he will have to re-sit if he passes the exams in the way that makes the sum of marks for all n exams equal exactly k .\n\n    Input\n    The input contains space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 250) \u2014 the number of exams and the required sum of marks. It is guaranteed that there exists a way to pass n exams in the way that makes the sum of marks equal exactly k .\n\n    Output\n    Output the single number \u2014 the minimum number of exams that the author will get a 2 for, considering that the sum of marks for all exams must equal k.\n*/\n```\nACSL FORMAL SPECIFICATION:\n```c\n/*@\npredicate IsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    result == n2;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    n2 < result;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n;\n*/\n\n/*@\nrequires  1 <= n <= 50;\n    requires  1 <= k <= 250;\n    requires ExistsPossibleConfiguration(n, k);\n    assigns \\nothing;\n    ensures IsPossibleConfiguration(n, k, \\result);\n    ensures !ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(n, k, \\result);\n*/\n```\nFUNCTION SIGNATURE:\n```c\nint calculateMinimumExamsToResitForGivenSum(int n, int k);\n```\n--- END CONTEXT ---\n\nYOUR TASK:\n\nYou must adhere to the following rules:\n * Keep the function signature exactly as provided.\n * Respect all ACSL pre- and postconditions.\n * If the natural language description and ACSL conflict, follow the ACSL.\n * Do not repeat the natural language description, the ACSL, or the extra code.\n * Do not add explanations or comments.\n * Do not use any type of loops (for, while, do-while).

He had n exams and he needed to get an integer from 2 to 5 for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams. Help the author and find the minimum number of exams he will have to re-sit if he passes the exams in the way that makes the sum of marks for all n exams equal exactly k .\n\n    Input\n    The input contains space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 250) \u2014 the number of exams and the required sum of marks. It is guaranteed that there exists a way to pass n exams in the way that makes the sum of marks equal exactly k .\n\n    Output\n    Output the single number \u2014 the minimum number of exams that the author will get a 2 for, considering that the sum of marks for all exams must equal k.\n*/\n```\nACSL FORMAL SPECIFICATION:\n```c\n/*@\npredicate IsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    result == n2;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    n2 < result;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n;\n*/\n\n/*@\nrequires  1 <= n <= 50;\n    requires  1 <= k <= 250;\n    requires ExistsPossibleConfiguration(n, k);\n    assigns \\nothing;\n    ensures IsPossibleConfiguration(n, k, \\result);\n    ensures !ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(n, k, \\result);\n*/\n```\nFUNCTION SIGNATURE:\n```c\nint calculateMinimumExamsToResitForGivenSum(int n, int k);\n```\n--- END CONTEXT ---\n\nYOUR TASK:\n\nYou must adhere to the following rules:\n * Keep the function signature exactly as provided.\n * Respect all ACSL pre- and postconditions.\n * If the natural language description and ACSL conflict, follow the ACSL.\n * Do not repeat the natural language description, the ACSL, or the extra code.\n * Do not add explanations or comments.\n * Do not use any type of loops (for, while, do-while).

He had n exams and he needed to get an integer from 2 to 5 for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams. Help the author and find the minimum number of exams he will have to re-sit if he passes the exams in the way that makes the sum of marks for all n exams equal exactly k .\n\n    Input\n    The input contains space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 250) \u2014 the number of exams and the required sum of marks. It is guaranteed that there exists a way to pass n exams in the way that makes the sum of marks equal exactly k .\n\n    Output\n    Output the single number \u2014 the minimum number of exams that the author will get a 2 for, considering that the sum of marks for all exams must equal k.\n*/\n```\nACSL FORMAL SPECIFICATION:\n```c\n/*@\npredicate IsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    result == n2;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(integer n, integer k, integer result) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n &&\n    n2 < result;\n*/\n\n/*@\npredicate ExistsPossibleConfiguration(integer n, integer k) =\n    \\exists integer n2, n3, n4, n5;\n    0 <= n2 <= n &&\n    0 <= n3 <= n &&\n    0 <= n4 <= n &&\n    0 <= n5 <= n &&\n    2 * n2 + 3 * n3 + 4 * n4 + 5 * n5 == k &&\n    n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 == n;\n*/\n\n/*@\nrequires  1 <= n <= 50;\n    requires  1 <= k <= 250;\n    requires ExistsPossibleConfiguration(n, k);\n    assigns \\nothing;\n    ensures IsPossibleConfiguration(n, k, \\result);\n    ensures !ExistsSmallerAmountOfResits(n, k, \\result);\n*/\n```\nFUNCTION SIGNATURE:\n```c\nint calculateMinimumExamsToResitForGivenSum(int n, int k);\n```\n--- END CONTEXT ---\n\nYOUR TASK:\n\nYou must adhere to the following rules:\n * Keep the function signature exactly as provided.\n * Respect all ACSL pre- and postconditions.\n * If the natural language description and ACSL conflict, follow the ACSL.\n * Do not repeat the natural language description, the ACSL, or the extra code.\n * Do not add explanations or comments.\n * Do not use any type of loops (for, while, do-while).

He had n exams and he needed to get an integer from 2 to 5 for each exam. He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all.

He will have to re-sit each failed exam, i.e. the exam that gets mark 2 . The author would need to spend too much time and effort to make the sum of his marks strictly more than k . That could have spoilt the Codeforces round. On the other hand, if the sum of his marks is strictly less than k , the author's mum won't be pleased at all. The Codeforces authors are very smart and they always get the mark they choose themselves. Also, the Codeforces authors just hate re-sitting exams.
