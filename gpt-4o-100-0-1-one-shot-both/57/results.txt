The second mode is mode of month,  where day ( 1 <= x <= 31 ) denotes the day of the month.\n\n    Output\n    Return one integer \u2014 the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016.\n*/\n\n/*@\nlogic integer num_candies_by_weekday(integer x) =\n        366 / 7 + (int) ((x + 2) % 7 < 366 % 7);\n\n    logic integer MonthTable(integer month) =\n        month == 1  ? 31 :\n        month == 2  ? 29 :\n        month == 3  ? 31 :\n        month == 4  ? 30 :\n        month == 5  ? 31 :\n        month == 6  ? 30 :\n        month == 7  ? 31 :\n        month == 8  ? 31 :\n        month == 9  ? 30 :\n        month == 10 ? 31 :\n        month == 11 ? 30 :\n        month == 12 ? 31 :\n        0;\n\n    logic integer num_candies_by_monthday(integer month, int n) =\n        (month <= 0) ? 0  : (MonthTable(month) >= n ? 1 : 0) + num_candies_by_monthday(month - 1, n);\n*/\n\n/*@\nrequires mode == 0 || mode == 1;\n    requires (mode == 0) ==> 1 <= day <= 7;\n    requires (mode == 1) ==> 1 <= day <= 31;\n    // mode == 0 \u2192 weekday mode, mode == 1 \u2192 monthday mode\n    assigns \\nothing;\n    ensures (mode == 0) ==> \\result == num_candies_by_weekday(day);\n    ensures (mode == 1) ==> \\result == num_candies_by_monthday(12, day);\n*/\n\nint count_candies(int day, int mode) {\n    if (mode == 0) {\n        return 366 / 7 + ((day + 2) % 7 < 366 % 7);\n    } else {\n        int MonthTable[12] = {31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};\n        int num_candies_by_monthday(int month, int n) {\n            return month <= 0 ? 0 : (MonthTable[month - 1] >= n ? 1 : 0) + num_candies_by_monthday(month - 1, n);\n        }\n        return num_candies_by_monthday(12, day);\n    }\n}\n",

The second mode is mode of month,  where day ( 1 <= x <= 31 ) denotes the day of the month.\n\n    Output\n    Return one integer \u2014 the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016.\n*/\n\n/*@\nlogic integer num_candies_by_weekday(integer x) =\n        366 / 7 + (int) ((x + 2) % 7 < 366 % 7);\n\n    logic integer MonthTable(integer month) =\n        month == 1  ? 31 :\n        month == 2  ? 29 :\n        month == 3  ? 31 :\n        month == 4  ? 30 :\n        month == 5  ? 31 :\n        month == 6  ? 30 :\n        month == 7  ? 31 :\n        month == 8  ? 31 :\n        month == 9  ? 30 :\n        month == 10 ? 31 :\n        month == 11 ? 30 :\n        month == 12 ? 31 :\n        0;\n\n    logic integer num_candies_by_monthday(integer month, int n) =\n        (month <= 0) ? 0  : (MonthTable(month) >= n ? 1 : 0) + num_candies_by_monthday(month - 1, n);\n*/\n\n/*@\nrequires mode == 0 || mode == 1;\n    requires (mode == 0) ==> 1 <= day <= 7;\n    requires (mode == 1) ==> 1 <= day <= 31;\n    // mode == 0 \u2192 weekday mode, mode == 1 \u2192 monthday mode\n    assigns \\nothing;\n    ensures (mode == 0) ==> \\result == num_candies_by_weekday(day);\n    ensures (mode == 1) ==> \\result == num_candies_by_monthday(12, day);\n*/\n\nint count_candies(int day, int mode) {\n    if (mode == 0) { // weekday mode\n        return 366 / 7 + ((day + 2) % 7 < 366 % 7);\n    } else { // mode == 1, monthday mode\n        int January = day <= 31;\n        int February = day <= 29;\n        int March = day <= 31;\n        int April = day <= 30;\n        int May = day <= 31;\n        int June = day <= 30;\n        int July = day <= 31;\n        int August = day <= 31;\n        int September = day <= 30;\n        int October = day <= 31;\n        int November = day <= 30;\n        int December = day <= 31;\n        return January + February + March + April + May + June + \n               July + August + September + October + November + December;\n    }\n}\n",
