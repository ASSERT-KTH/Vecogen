Act as an experienced software engineer that works as a coder and implements safety-critical systems. You are given a specification and are required to write code adhering to the specification. The specifications are given in ACSL and the program code will be verified using the framework Frama-C You must adhere to the following rules:
1. Only give the output code
2. The output code must be written in C
3. You can add invariants and assertions for loops if these improve the verification process
4. Give comments for difficult functions
5. Use the parameters defined in the specification
6. Use the specification listen in the header file given below

The header file  containing a description and a formal specification

```
/* Method binary_search() looks for an integer x in a sorted array arr[] of size n.
    If x is found, the method returns the index of x in arr[];
    otherwise, it returns -1. */
