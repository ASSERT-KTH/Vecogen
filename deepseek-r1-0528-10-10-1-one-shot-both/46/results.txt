                    "gpt_output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps an elephant must take to move from position 0 to position x on a coordinate line, where each step can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward. The solution should be efficient and adhere to the given constraints and formal specifications.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is recognizing that the elephant can cover the distance in the fewest steps by maximizing the step size whenever possible. The minimal number of steps required is equivalent to the ceiling of the division of the distance \\( x \\) by the maximum step size (5). This is because:\n1. Any distance \\( x \\) can be covered by using as many steps of size 5 as possible, followed by smaller steps if necessary.\n2. The remainder after dividing \\( x \\) by 5 (i.e., \\( x \\mod 5 \\)) can always be covered in at most one additional step, since the remainder will be between 1 and 4, which are valid step sizes.\n3. Therefore, the total number of steps is \\( \\lceil x / 5 \\rceil \\), which can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as \\( (x + 4) / 5 \\) for positive \\( x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```c\nint calculateMinimumElephantSteps(int x) {\n    return (x + 4) / 5;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The elephant starts at position 0 and needs to reach position \\( x \\) (where \\( 1 \\leq x \\leq 1,000,000 \\)) by taking steps of sizes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The goal is to minimize the number of steps.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal steps required to cover \\( x \\) is given by the ceiling of \\( x / 5 \\), because the elephant can take the largest possible step (5) as many times as possible, and the remainder (if any) is covered in one additional step (since any remainder between 1 and 4 can be covered in one step).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution leverages integer arithmetic to compute \\( \\lceil x / 5 \\rceil \\) as \\( (x + 4) / 5 \\). This works because for positive integers, adding 4 before division ensures that any remainder effectively increments the quotient by 1, thus rounding up the result.\n4. **Complexity**: The computation is a constant-time operation \\( O(1) \\), making it highly efficient even for the upper constraint \\( x = 1,000,000 \\).\n5. **Formal Specifications**: The solution satisfies all given ACSL conditions by ensuring that the result is the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that \\( x \\) can be expressed as \\( n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 + 4n4 + 5n5 \\) with \\( n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 = k \\), and no smaller \\( k \\) exists. The proof involves showing that \\( k = \\lceil x / 5 \\rceil \\) is both achievable and minimal.\n\nThus, the solution efficiently computes the minimal steps using a straightforward arithmetic expression, adhering to all constraints and formal specifications.",

The solution should be efficient and adhere to the given constraints and formal specifications.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is recognizing that the elephant can cover the distance in the fewest steps by maximizing the step size whenever possible. The minimal number of steps required is equivalent to the ceiling of the division of the distance \\( x \\) by the maximum step size (5). This is because:\n1. Any distance \\( x \\) can be covered by using as many steps of size 5 as possible, followed by smaller steps if necessary.\n2. The remainder after dividing \\( x \\) by 5 (i.e., \\( x \\mod 5 \\)) can always be covered in at most one additional step, since the remainder will be between 1 and 4, which are valid step sizes.\n3. Therefore, the total number of steps is \\( \\lceil x / 5 \\rceil \\), which can be efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as \\( (x + 4) / 5 \\) for positive \\( x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```c\nint calculateMinimumElephantSteps(int x) {\n    return (x + 4) / 5;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The elephant starts at position 0 and needs to reach position \\( x \\) (where \\( 1 \\leq x \\leq 1,000,000 \\)) by taking steps of sizes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The goal is to minimize the number of steps.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal steps required to cover \\( x \\) is given by the ceiling of \\( x / 5 \\), because the elephant can take the largest possible step (5) as many times as possible, and the remainder (if any) is covered in one additional step (since any remainder between 1 and 4 can be covered in one step).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution leverages integer arithmetic to compute \\( \\lceil x / 5 \\rceil \\) as \\( (x + 4) / 5 \\). This works because for positive integers, adding 4 before division ensures that any remainder effectively increments the quotient by 1, thus rounding up the result.\n4. **Complexity**: The computation is a constant-time operation \\( O(1) \\), making it highly efficient even for the upper constraint \\( x = 1,000,000 \\).\n5. **Formal Specifications**: The solution satisfies all given ACSL conditions by ensuring that the result is the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that \\( x \\) can be expressed as \\( n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 + 4n4 + 5n5 \\) with \\( n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 = k \\), and no smaller \\( k \\) exists. The proof involves showing that \\( k = \\lceil x / 5 \\rceil \\) is both achievable and minimal.\n\nThus, the solution efficiently computes the minimal steps using a straightforward arithmetic expression, adhering to all constraints and formal specifications.",
